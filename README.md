# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## Planning
1. Make the components-
Header
Body
 -SideBar
   -MenuList
 -MainContainer
   -ButtonList
   -VideoContainer
      -VideoCard

2.First we will make the header portion and in that we use grid and flex to place the items 
3. Now we will make the sidebar component
4. Make the functionality of the menu toggle part we use Redux toolkit
   1. Firstly we will install @reduxjs/toolkit
   2. Then install react-redux
   3. Make the store by using configureStore and name the slice name
   4. Make the slice by using create slice and make reducers so that it will take action and export the reducer and action
   5. Then use Provider to the whole app
   6. The check the action is performed or not by using redux extension or by using useSelector hook
   7. And then who was perform the function they will be dispatch the action by using useDispatch hook from react-redux library
   8. Then subscribe the store by using useSelector hook (who have to performed that function)
5. Using High Order Function - it takes a function component and return a update component
   Why we using HOF - because when we have to do some modification on the component then use HOF
6. IMPORTANT TOPIC - Debouncing
7. Search feature - in that we use youtube api key , debouncing (setTimeout - which is used for not calling the api of every keyletter) and caching (Redux store - which is used to not call the again and again same keyword)
